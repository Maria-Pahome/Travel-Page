              Hiking" is the preferred term in Canada and the United States; the
              term "walking" is used in these regions for shorter, particularly
              urban walks. In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, the
              word "walking" describes all forms of walking, whether it is a walk
              in the park or backpacking in the Alps. The word hiking is also
              often used in the UK, along with rambling (a slightly old-fashioned
              term), hillwalking, and fell walking (a term mostly used for
              hillwalking in northern England). The term bushwalking is endemic to
              Australia, having been adopted by the Sydney Bush Walkers club in
              1927. In New Zealand a long, vigorous walk or hike is called
              tramping. It is a popular activity with numerous hiking
              organizations worldwide, and studies suggest that all forms of
              walking have health benefits.

              Fashion is a form of self-expression and autonomy at a particular
              period and place and in a specific context, of clothing, footwear,
              lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle, and body posture. In its
              everyday use, the term implies a look defined by the fashion
              industry as that which is trending. Everything that is considered
              fashion is available and popular by the fashion system (industry and
              media).
